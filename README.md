## 🧠 AI & Decision Support

The current engine uses a rule-based inference mechanism to assess:

- Forecasted solar energy availability
- Battery charge/discharge cycles and thresholds
- Aggregate appliance load against available capacity
- Load shifting recommendations based on priority and surplus energy.

> Future enhancements will integrate adaptive machine learning models for behavior prediction and adaptive load management.
